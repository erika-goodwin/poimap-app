This is a Next.js app with Mapbox's map and Clerk's authorization function. The application is built with my favorite CSS library Tailwindcss. The database is MongoDB.

### Why made me create this app?

his time's purpose was trying to create something similar application to what I used in daily life. Whenever Iâ€™m out just for work or school, I use Google Maps to check the bus time and where to go. The function I often use is making my POI list for where I have been, where I want to visit in the future, and my favorite place to keep my shop name in the list. Therefore, I tried to make a POI map app.

### What was challenging?

In the end, I settled on using Mapbox for the map. Initially, I tried to implement Google Maps API. I asked for much help from my teacher, and developer friend, however, the only thing I was able to do in a week was showing the map on my app. I got stressed and pressured since I spent too much time only showing the map. From this project, I learned sometimes I need to give up on something and move on. Sometimes we would encounter something we cannot handle YET. And there is always another way we can achieve our same goal. Using Mapbox was junior-level friendly and people seem to like it as well. I would like to give a gold star for my experience learning from this project.

### Goals for Improvement

I regret I didn't implement Redux for this project. I should have designed file structures first to see how big is this project going to be. If so, I could have used Redux for a more approachable and organized data design. My improvement for my next project will be sufficient preparation including mockup design, file structure, database structure, and research of language, libraries, and APIs.
